In this post, I am describing the framework we use for the team offsites we've been doing at Wing
Cloud since we started the company, and why I think they must be part of the cultural foundation for
a distributed team.

## Distributed teams rock

In 2017, when I moved to AWS to start the CDK team, me and my husband were already expecting our
twins. We used to live in San Francisco at the time, and the plan was to move back to Tel-Aviv once
the kids join our family. Flat, warm and tons of family sounded like a better environment to raise a
couple of rascals as oppose to the hilly, chilly and far away SF (it turned out to be a very wise
decision given we have three sets of fully functional and incredible grandparents).

So when I accepted the offer to move from Amazon to AWS, it was already clear that the CDK team is
going to be a distributed team. We have already started chatting with [Romain Muller] and [Rico
Huijbers], both based in Europe. This was actually a very uncommon model for Amazon teams, but I
felt it made a lot of sense given the AWS CDK was going to be an open-source project, and we would
have contributors from around the world anyway.

During COVID, many teams around the world discovered the awesome potential of distributed teams.
Besides more flexibility, more work/life balance and ability to bring talent from around the world,
the distributed nature of the team encourages more asynchronous communication, individual ownership
and organized workflows. It comes with no surprise that open source workflows, methodologies and
tools work very well in such teams.

## The "remote paranoia" syndrome

But COVID also helped me realize it's not all sunshine and roses. As the pandemic hit and travel
stopped, we weren't able to meet each other in person for a long period of time. And when you only
interact with your teammates through Zoom, your relationships become transactional and flat. Our
human brain needs subtext, body language, smell and energy in order to build trust. It needs
unstructured time to chat, and brainstorm and hang out. Without this human connection we being to
develop what I've been calling **Remote Paranoia**. Our brain starts to fill in this "blank space"
with negative narratives.

This takes many shapes and sizes, but here's a simple example that I am sure many of us experienced.
You send an excited email to a remote teammate about a great idea you had for the project and you
don't get a response for a few days. You don't understand why they didn't respond, so you start
telling yourself stories. Maybe they don't like your idea, maybe they think you stepped out of line,
maybe you said the wrong thing in the last team meeting. In reality, your teammate was super busy
with some other task and just didn't get a chance to read your email. They actually really love your
idea and once they finish what they are doing, he'd reach out and chat about it. This is **remote
paranoia**.

## Our team offsites

When we started Wing Cloud in 2022, we wanted to find a way to build a powerful distributed team,
while still maintaining a healthy and cohesive company culture. Based on my experience with the CDK
team, I knew that nothing can replace the simple human act of "hanging out", so we decided to bring
everyone together for an offsite at least 3-4 times a year.

We even mention these offsites in our offer letters to make it clear that we expect folks to make an
effort to attend them.

Since we started the company in April 2022, we've already had four of these offsites and their
format has been pretty stable.

## The goal is to be humans

Here's an excerpt from the email I've been sending our team before our offsites:

> The #1 goal is to hang out and get to know each other better as human beings. The team we are
> building at Wing Cloud is distributed around the world together with our community of
> collaborators and users. We believe distributed teams are better teams! They are more diverse in
> thought and culture, they are able to tap into talent all over the world, and their collaboration
> and communication skills are robust and powerful. They are rooted in open-source workflows,
> methodologies and culture. The flip side of being a distributed team is that we canâ€™t really smell
> each other over the internet, and after all, we are little animals walking on a tiny little planet
> drifting in an ever-expanding universe. So smelling each other is kind of important... This is why
> we plan to do these offsites regularly - we need to acknowledge our humanity and accept the fact
> that occasionally we do need high-bandwidth brain connections.

As you can see, the main goal is to to *hang out*. We emphasize that this is our primary priority.
It doesn't mean we don't get to do some work together, brainstorm or hack as you'll see below, but
it sets the stage about what's really important. After all, we all work together on a daily basis,
so if we haven't had a chance to discuss a certain topic or hack on something, we can just do it
after the offsite.

## As "off site" as possible

To get all of us into the right state of mind, I think it's important to extract ourselves from our
day to day lives completely. The only way I know how to do this is to go to some remote location,
say goodbye to families and daily schedules and spend a few days in an alternate reality.

It's also important that this place will be cosy, comfortable, beautiful and inspiring. Our human
souls are in a different mental state when we all sit down with drinks over a pool with a beautiful
view.

We've been conducting our offsites in a few amazing locations around Israel. Our team is small
enough to be able to rent out one or two very comfortable villas with [amazing views] of the Sea of
Galilee, a shared living area with a big kitchen, BBQ and pool.

## Day 1: Aligning frequencies

It takes time for a distributed team, especially with folks from multiple cultures and timezones, to
get into a frequency alignment. The first day of the offsite is dedicated to this.

Here's the high level schedule:

* **9am**: Leave the office in a big jolly bus.
* **noon**: Have lunch in a nice restaurant on the way.
* **4pm**: Arrive at the villa, settle in rooms.
* **4pm-6pm**: Chill, hang out, pool in, drink up, music.
* **6pm-8pm**: Prepare **communal dinner** together.
* **8pm-10pm**: Dinner + **story time**.

The **communal dinner** has been one of the most fun parts of these offsites for me. This is
inspired from the first offsite [Jason Fulghum] and I organized for the CDK team and has proven to
be an amazing way to bond and connect and make something together as a team. Before the event, each
team member signs up for a dish and the ingredients they need. Then, we all prepare dinner together
and help each other. Some people mix drinks, some people make their favorite desert, and some show
off with crazy cooking skills that no one expected. It always turns out super tasty and diverse and
colorful and a really fun team activity.

At dinner, we all sit down and praise each others dishes and at some point we have a tradition where
offsite "virgins" take the stage and **share stories** from their personal journey. It's a kind of
self introduction but there is no time limit or specific topics, and historically we've had folks
speak for 30-40 minutes, describing the first program they wrote or some embarrassing accident from
college, or a hobby they can't stop talking about. This is an example of something that you simply
cannot do over Zoom, and have been a really fun way to get to know each other as friends.

At that point, everyone is either completely drunk or incredibly jet legged. Some go to bed, some go
for a night swim, some hack together in the living room and some dance outside.

### Day 2+3: Do some work

The next two days are dedicated for "doing some work", and so far in each offsite they had a
different vibe and structure, so there's no specific framework. One thing that kind of worked was to
prepare a list of topics for inspiration. In one of the offsites we actually decided to spend most
of the time on fixing bugs or building an MVP of the Wing Playground, and then most of the time was
dedicated to simply working together in the same room, which is something we don't get to do in
normal times.

Here is a list activities we've been doing in these days. Not all of these are done with the entire
team. In fact, as the team grows, it feels more natural to have conversations in smaller groups.

* Brainstorming sessions - technical, product, business
* Group hacking - either on an actual feature or bug fix or prototyping something
* Listening to calls with customers and discussing them
* Learning about a new technology - watching a YouTube together or someone showing off a demo
* Code walkthroughs - someone takes us on a tour of a certain part of the system
* Decision sessions - complex topics to hash out and decide
* Live stream - at a community meeting or on Twitch, depending if something was scheduled
* Anything else goes

In these days, we usually eat leftovers from dinner during the day and order in food in the evening.
Drinks and pool and music are always welcome and we try to be sensitive to each other about taking
breaks and shifting energy.

These days oftentimes go on until very late at night. Some people would keep hacking at 2am and get
reminded that tomorrow is another day of messing up with each other.

### Day 4: Get some air

On the last day, we wake up, pack up our stuff and try to find some team outdoor activity. It could
be a small hike, beach, winery or something like that. The idea is to get some air and have fun in
the (sometimes too hot) Israeli sun.

We get back to Tel-Aviv in the afternoon with our bodies tanned, bellies full and brains completely
fried. Communicating with the entire team at full bandwidth is not something we are used to doing,
and as much as it's incredibly fun and fulfilling, it's also exhausting. Luckily, it's the weekend.

### Summary

I hope that sharing this would help other distributed teams like ours become better teams by simply
celebrating the important of the human connection. For us, every time one of these offsites
approaches, there's a sentiment that "it's about time" and mild signs of "remote paranoia". 

Then, we all get meet up, hug each other, smile, cook, drink, dance, geek out, hack, be foolish
together and remember how awesome this gang is.
