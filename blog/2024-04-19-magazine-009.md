> The 9th issue of the Wing Inflight Magazine.
> <!--truncate-->

Howdy Wingnuts!

I am pleased to share another issue of the *Wing Inflight Magazine* with recent updates and news from the [Winglang](https://winglang.io) project.
### So what is Wing again?

Wing is a **programming environment for the cloud**. It makes it easy for developers to build and test distributed systems that leverage a variety of powerful cloud primitives such as queues, topics, API endpoints, buckets, websites, topics and a growing ecosystem of [winglibs](https://github.com/winglang/winglibs) published by the community.

Wing comes with a **visual cloud simulator** which allows interacting and testing with your cloud application on your local machine with fast hot reloading without having to deploy a single resource to the cloud.

One of the unique capabilities of Wing is that it supports what we call **pluggable platform providers**. This means that applications can be *cloud- and provisioning-engine agnostic*, and deployed to various clouds using various provisioning engines.

There is already support for Terraform/OpenTofu, CloudFormation, AWS, GCP and Azure, and discussions about [Cloudflare](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/4298), [Crossplane](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/6268), [OpenShift](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/6273), [Azure Bicep](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/6271), [Pulumi](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/6272). Check out the [compatibility matrix](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/compatibility-matrix), add your 👍 to the relevant issue, and share your use case to help us prioritize!

Platform teams can also create their own custom platforms using CDK constructs. This offers central control over best practices, compliance policies, security, deployment strategies and any other aspect of how Wing applications are implemented in an organization's cloud environment.

**Wing is still in active development**, but we are starting to see some really cool stuff being built with it. If you are up for a really fun (yet possibly bumpy) ride, we encourage you to [take Wing for a spin on your local machine](https://www.winglang.io/docs) or in the [Wing Playground](https://www.winglang.io/play/) and [let us know](https://t.winglang.io/slack) what you think.

We are designing Wing to be **familiar and friendly** for developers who come from modern object-oriented background such as TypeScript, Swift, C# and Java, so it will take you [5 minutes](https://github.com/winglang/workshop-react/blob/main/cheatsheet.md) to learn.

### Default IDs no longer include namespace  

`new cloud.Bucket()` previously created a resource with an ID of `cloud.Bucket`.

Now, the ID is just `Bucket`.

This avoids a bug where changing the namespace would cause the ID to change. For the non-aliased namespace this was not an issue, but for `bring "@cdktf/provider-aws" as aws;` it was if you decided to change `aws` to `awsProvider`.

[See PR by Elad](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/5658)

### `cloud.Function`s simulator improvements

In previous versions of the local simulator, invoked `cloud.Function`s always ran concurrently and did not share execution contexts. This was done with Node's `vm` api to execute inflight JavaScript.

Both of these facts had unfortunate implications:
- `vm` has several limitations and bugs
- No maximum concurrency
- In most real cloud function environments, sequential invocations often share execution contexts

Now, `cloud.Function` uses a worker pool of full Node processes that can also be reused between invocations.

### Implicitly loaded platform files

As Wing compiles your code, any `wplatform.js` files found will be loaded automatically as a platform. This occurs after explicit ones like `-t tf-aws`. This also applies to any wing libraries used!

One of the currently explored use cases is the ability for libraries to expose their own platform parameters.

For example, the `@winglibs/eventbridge` winglib exposes a platform parameter to instead import an existing event bus.  

```js
module.exports.Platform = class {
  parameters = {
    type: "object",
	  properties: {
	    eventBridgeName: {
	    type: "string",
	  },
	},
  };
};
```

### Cron schedules are now more cloud agnostic  

A cron expression like `* * * * *` is valid in a unix-based crontab, but not in AWS.

On the other hand, `* * * * ?` is valid in AWS, but not elsewhere.  

Now, Wing will expect cron expression to match the more standard syntax and will automatically convert it to the AWS syntax when deploying to AWS.

```js
bring cloud;

new cloud.Schedule(cron: "* * * * *");
```

### Debugging with breakpoints
  
With the VS Code extension, breakpoints can be added to .w files, both for preflight and inflight. A standard javascript debugger can be used with this to inspect and step through the code.

### Explicit lifting of preflight objects

New builtin `lift` function allows you to lift preflight objects for the current inflight closure.

The current syntax is experimental and already has some planned changes.

```js

class Foo {
  pub inflight method() {
    // Explicitly add some permissions to `bucket`
    lift(bucket, ["put", "delete"]); 

    // We can now use an inflight variable `b` to reference 
    // a preflight object `bucket`
    let b = bucket;
    b.put("k2", "value2"); // This will no longer fail due to the explicit lift
  }
}
```

### Expose cloud endpoints through the console

Any resources that use `cloud.Endpoint` will show up in the "Endpoints" section of the Wing Console as a clickable link.

> [See PR by Elad](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/5792)

### `bring ui` is now supported in Wing Console  

`ui` is a builtin module that allows you to add UI elements to interact with in the Console!  

```js
bring ui;

class MyResource {
  counter: cloud.Counter;
  new() {
    this.counter = new cloud.Counter();
    
    new ui.Button("Cool Button", inflight () => {
      this.counter.inc();
    });

    new ui.Field("Counter", inflight () => {
      return "{this.counter.peek()}";
    });
  }
}
```

### React vite

[https://www.winglang.io/docs/guides/react-vite-websockets](https://www.winglang.io/docs/guides/react-vite-websockets)

To expedite the project creation process, consider leveraging the react-vite quickstart template:

```sh
wing new react-vite
```
