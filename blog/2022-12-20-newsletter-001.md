WIP

> Issue 001


Welcome to the Wing Inflight Magazine! Here you will find all the latest information you need to keep yourself up to 
date with the latest information about Wing!

[include some sort of video/animation here]

Wing released on November 23rd, 2022 as closed alpha with the [winglang.io](https://winglang.io) website going live 
and the [first blog post](https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2022/11/23/manifesto) 
from [Elad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hackingonstuff/) about why cloud oriented programming is so needed in today’s 
modern cloud development landscape.

Since then, we’ve had over 1000 people sign up for access to Wing! 
We’ve seen incredible interest throughout the community with great feedback from strong leaders within the AWS community like 
**[Ben Kohoe](https://twitter.com/ben11kehoe)**, 
**[Jeremy Daly](https://twitter.com/jeremy_daly)**, 
and **[Dax Raad](https://twitter.com/thdxr)** 
(who recorded the first community-driven [video on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1662688985)). 
We’ve had over 400 members engage in our Slack server and many comments and discussions on Issues and Pull Requests. 

Finally, we needed a term for our members. A poll was conducted in the Slack channel and the community voted by
majority for 'Wingnuts'. Check out the announcement video:

Now the hard work really begins as all the eyes are on us! The team has been tearing away on new features. 
The community has stepped up and also been contributing with pull requests and opening issues. 
Here are some highlights on what’s been going on:

## Community

* Wing was featured on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34051325).
  * "This is one of the more sophisticated and cool of the "Self Provisioning Runtime" concepts that have emerged 
in the last few years" - [zoomzoom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=340533940)
  * "I think there would be a lot of value in having an imperativ(sic), very high level language for cloud workflows that 
abstracts the underlying implementation or even cloud provider away." - [wolframhempel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34055556)
  * "Great works! Seeing the demo in the front page really makes me think of the cloud architecture as a whole may 
just be an operating system out of itself." - [stevefan1999](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34054752)
  * "That animation on the home page is sick af" - [tomcam](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34056121)
  * "The team is top notch (of CDK fame) found a non-trivial bug was assigned and fixed in 30 min. In general joy to 
interact with. Very strong focus on dev. experience. After a very subpar experience of building a very large enterprise 
project using AWS serverless stack Wing is the first thing that gives me hope that things can be way better." - [qaq](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34053585)
