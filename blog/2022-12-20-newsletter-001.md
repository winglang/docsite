WIP

> Issue 001

Welcome to the Wing Inflight Magazine! Here you will find all the latest information about Wing!

[include some sort of video/animation here]

Wing released on November 23rd, 2022 as closed alpha with the [winglang.io](https://winglang.io) website going live 
and the [first blog post](https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2022/11/23/manifesto) 
from [Elad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hackingonstuff/) about why cloud oriented programming is so needed in today’s 
modern cloud development landscape.

Since then, we’ve had over 1300 people sign up for access to Wing! 
We’ve seen incredible interest throughout the community with great feedback from strong leaders within the AWS community like 
**[Ben Kohoe](https://twitter.com/ben11kehoe)**, 
**[Jeremy Daly](https://twitter.com/jeremy_daly)**, 
and **[Dax Raad](https://twitter.com/thdxr)** 
(who recorded the first community-driven [video on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1662688985)). 
We’ve had over 400 members engage in our Slack server and many comments and discussions on Issues and Pull Requests. 

Finally, we needed a term for our community members. A poll was conducted in the Slack channel and the people voted by
majority for 'Wingnuts'. Check out the announcement video:

Now the hard work really begins as all the eyes are on us! The team has been tearing away on new features. 
The community has stepped up and also been contributing with pull requests and opening issues. 
Here are some highlights on what’s been going on:

## Community

* Wing was featured on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34051325).
  * "This is one of the more sophisticated and cool of the "Self Provisioning Runtime" concepts that have emerged 
in the last few years" - [zoomzoom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=340533940)
  * "I think there would be a lot of value in having an imperativ(sic), very high level language for cloud workflows that 
abstracts the underlying implementation or even cloud provider away." - [wolframhempel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34055556)
  * "Great works! Seeing the demo in the front page really makes me think of the cloud architecture as a whole may 
just be an operating system out of itself." - [stevefan1999](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34054752)
  * "That animation on the home page is sick af" - [tomcam](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34056121)
  * "The team is top notch (of CDK fame) found a non-trivial bug was assigned and fixed in 30 min. In general joy to 
interact with. Very strong focus on dev. experience. After a very subpar experience of building a very large enterprise 
project using AWS serverless stack Wing is the first thing that gives me hope that things can be way better." - [qaq](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34053585)
* 400+ active members in Slack
* 100+ active members in GitHub
* 75+ stars in GitHub
* 100+ Pull Requests closed
* A new community member, [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig), recommended we alias `wing run` to `wing it`, 
an idea we loved! A PR was submitted by community member [Raywon Kari](https://github.com/raywonkari), 
and it was merged in under 15 minutes!
* Another community member, [Owen Watkins](https://github.com/ogre14t) submitted a PR 
to [add line numbering](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/928) to the playground.
* [Eric Riddoch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-riddoch/) posted a nice vision for the potential of Wing 
on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eric-riddoch_winglang-activity-7010524643191115776-nk1x/).

## Language changes

* The language now has a `while` statement. You can see the changes [here](https://github.com/winglang/wing/commit/12a9c8a48459ae3e533900208e4d749eba369631).
  
  `while` loops are a staple of any language, and now we've got them in Wing! They're just as simple to use as you might
  think.

  ```wing
  let y = 123;
  while y < 0 {
    let x = 1;
  }
  ```


* We dropped the `~` for inflight modifiers in favor of the explicit `inflight` keyword. 
  
  A while back, we introduced a shorthand for the inflight keyword, a `~`. So, you could do this when writing an 
  async/inflight handler:
  
  ```wing
  let handler = () ~> { ... };
  ```
  
  However, we listened to community feedback, and we felt this wasn't very intuitive or easy to read. So, we removed it!
  
  Now you will just use the `inflight` keyword in front of the function declaration. 

  Please see the [commit](https://github.com/winglang/wing/commit/a382b5582584b64b85ba0627940813225a0d489d) 
  for more details on why.
  
* [Enums](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/273) have been added.

  Enums are another staple of most languages. 

  ```wing
  enum RecordType {
    CUSTOMER, ORDER, INVOICE
  }
  let customerType = RecordType.CUSTOMER; // valid
  let returnType = RecordType.RETURN; // invalid
  ```

* [Arrays](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/824) have been added.
  
  Do you need something? What if you need multiple of something?! Well that's what Arrays are for! They're kind of
  a big deal...

  ```wing
  let implicitArray = [1, 2, 3]; // implicit array types
  let explicitArray = Array<num>[1, 2, 3]; // explicit array types
  let anotherExplicitArray: Array<num> = [1, 2, 3]; // another way of defining an explicity array
  
  let mediaBucket = new cloud.Bucket() as "mediaBucket";
  let uploadBucket = new cloud.Bucket() as "uploadBucket";
  let docsBucket = new cloud.Bucket() as "docsBucket";
  let arrayOfBuckets = [mediaBucket, uploadBucket, docsBucket];
  ```


## SDK changes

* The Topic polycon was implemented! [#867](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/867) from [Hasan](https://github.com/hasanaburayyan).

  Do you need to publish a message for a decoupled processing mechanism? Then you probably want a topic. Topics are 
  repositories for messages. 

  ```wing
  bring cloud;
  
  let topic = new cloud.Topic();
  
  topic.on_message(inflight (message: str)=> { ... });

  ```


* The Visual Studio Code Extension is now published in the Visual Studio Marketplace, you can [get it here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Monada.vscode-wing).

  The VSCode extension will help you during development by highlight code, show you syntax problems, and type errors. 

* New simulator file format [#770](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/770).

  Originally the `wing compile` would produce a `.wx` file. This was basically a JSON file. But, that wasn't really 
  doing everything we wanted. So, we've split things out now. There is a `.wsim` file which has information specifically
  for the simulator and a `tree.json` which contains the construct tree.
  

* Delete bucket object [#857](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/857).

  ```wing
  let bucket = new Bucket();
  let queue = new Queue();
  
  queue.on_message(inflight (message: str) => {
    bucket.delete('wing.txt');
  });
  ```

  We let you create objects in a bucket, and that's pretty great. But, things aren't always meant to last. So, now 
  you can also delete objects from a bucket.

* ['std' namespace loaded implicitly](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/976).

  The `std` namespace is pretty great, and you're going to use it. Like, all the time. So, we went ahead and saved you
  some trouble and just made it so `std` is always brought.

  ```wing
  bring std; // no longer needed
  bring cloud; 
  
  // ...
  ```

* An open [issue](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/489) about using Terraform resources.

  We think polycons are pretty great, and you'll be using a lot. But, maybe not ALL the time, so we decided to make it
  so you can use CDK for Terraform resources directly. For example:

  ```wing
  bring "@cdktf/provider-github" as github;

  new github.repository.Repository(
    name: "example",
    description: "An awesome example",
    visibility: "public",
  );
  ```
  
  This is an open issue, so if you have questions or concerns please ask them in the link above.


## Console changes

* The console now supports [hot reloading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvrGgGffLOc).

  When we first launched, the console was great, but you had to constantly recompile your code behind the scenes. That's
  not a very good experience. The best part is this change is mostly transparent. Just run wing:

  ```shell
  $ wing run hello.w
  ```
  
  That's it! The cli will run the console and automatically recompile changes for you!

* Tons of fixes around M1 and ARM processors.

## RFCs

* Discussion around the [Wing Playground](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/451)

  The playground is an area where you can get started with Wing without having to install anything on your machine. 
  If you want to try out new features without having to upgrade anything, that's the playground. Please join in the
  discussion above.

* [CLI Design](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/258)

  Design, design, design. Good software is designed extensively. This has been open for a while but that doesn't mean
  you can't chime in voice you concerns. In fact, we really encourage you all to join in on the conversation at the link
  above. 

  For example, what kind of details would you want to see in a `help` command? Do you think there should be specific
  output when compiling? Do you have strong opinions about where compilation artifacts are stored?

* [Algebraic data types / enum-like classes](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/977)

  Do you like floating points? Do you need signed integers? How do you want enumerated types to work with numbers? 

  Do you think Swift's enums are the best? What about Typescript? Or Rust?! Which number systems and enum types work
  the best for you?

* [Wing Spec](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/858)

  Wing has an extensive spec, and it's growing every day. We have included it in the wing repository now so you can
  always have it for quick reference.

## Updating to latest

There have been lots of updates, so don't forget to install the latest versions:
