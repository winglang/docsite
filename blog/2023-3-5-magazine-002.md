### Check out the latest Wingly Update episode

**The Wingly Update** is a live show we are streaming on Twitch. We mostly make fools of ourselves, talk about the latest developments of the project, bring guests and more.

In our [last show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb6oQdrGYWc), [Eyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eyal-keren-b23b7231/) hosted [Elad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hackingonstuff),
[Cristian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-pallar√©s-88139916/) and the infamous [Mark the DJ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-mcculloh/).

We talked about:
- Immutable by default
- Customize infrastructure using compiler plugins
- Create composable clour abstractions
- `import` and use CDK libraries
- Realtime visualization of your cloud applications 

If you didn‚Äôt get a chance to catch it live, you can tune in [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb6oQdrGYWc) and check out our next shows on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/winglangio).

### User stories are now published to our doc site

Our user stories are [working backwards](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/business/dealbook/amazon-working-backwards.html) documents that tell a story about someone in the future and what they can do with Wing. 
They contain detailed descriptions of where we want to be at the end of each iteration of the project. 
Stories are part of our development process as they allow us to track our progress, provide feedback, 
and ensure that we are always focused on the end-to-end experience. By reviewing the stories, you can actually see the evolution of the project.

For example, we are now working on [User story #15](https://docs.winglang.io/contributors/rfcs/stories/story-15) which includes support for 
[using JavaScript libraries in Wing](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/478), 
the [`cloud.Api`](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/623) resource, 
a [`Redis` resource](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/611)
and [interface declarations](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/123).

### Wing Console gets a new map view

The [Wing Console](https://docs.winglang.io/start-here/local) is a desktop application that can be used to interact with Wing applications
and its resources on the local machine. 
One of the biggest challenges of the console is how to visualize a complex real-world cloud applications. In the latest release, we've leveraged the [ELK layout algorithm](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/documentation.html) to create an interactive map of the resources generated by Wing so and visualize the resource hierarchy and their connections.

With this new map view, you can visualize both the static structure and the data flow of your cloud application at a glance. Cloud resources are connected to each other depending on usage, giving you a clear view of the dependencies and interactions between different parts of your application.

### Wing Console adds support for log filtering

We've also added a log filtering feature to help you easily filter logs by keywords or levels.

### Compiler errors and the "blue screen of death"

When the console compiles your Wing code in the background, if it encounters compiler errors, we now display them in a view that is a homage to the Windows [Blue Screen of Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death). File locations are links and will jump right into your IDE.

Here's a short video:

### User-defined resources

The most important aspect of a programming language is it's composition primitives. Wing has a special type of classes called "resources". Resources are an object-oriented representation of a cloud service that is part of the application. For example `cloud.Bucket` is a resource that represents an object storage. In essence, they are the cloud-oriented version of a class, but with unique capabilities that allow them to represent both infrastructure and code.

So far, resources were only available as part of the Wing SDK, but now it is possible to declare resources in Wing and create reusable building blocks. Similarly to functions and classes, resources can be used to organize your code into logical units, shared, reused and in the future also published into independent libraries.

One key aspect of user-defined resources is their ability to define an "inflight API". This is done by adding the `inflight` modifier to methods or fields. The inflight execution scope is essentially the runtime API of the resource, while the preflight execution scope represents the resource's configuration and initialization.

In the following example, we are declaring a resource called `DoubleBucket`. When an object is `put()` into the resource
it will be replicated into two buckets.

```js
bring cloud;

resource DoubleBucket {
  a: cloud.Bucket;
  b: cloud.Bucket;
  
  init(a: cloud.Bucket, b: cloud.Bucket) {
    this.a = a;
    this.b = b;
  }
  
  inflight put(key: str, obj: str) {
    this.a.put(key, obj);
    this.b.put(key, obj);
  }
  
  inflight get(key: str): str {
    return this.a.get(key);
  }
}

let left = new cloud.Bucket();
let right = new cloud.Bucket();

let r = new DoubleBucket(left, right);

new cloud.Function(inflight (s: str): str => {
  r.put("hello.txt", "world");
});
```

Within that resource, you can see the concept of an `inflight` modifier on both the `put()` and `get()` methods. If you need a reminder of the terms inflight and preflight, read the [spec](https://docs.winglang.io/contributors/rfcs/language-spec#13-phase-modifiers) or the [inflight functions](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/inflights) section in our docs.

This example demonstrates how user-defined resources can create composable units that allow for the creation of higher-level abstractions.

There are many capabilities that user-defined resources open up, and you can read more about them in the [language specification](https://docs.winglang.io/contributors/rfcs/language-spec#33-preflight-classes), as well as in specific issues and [pull requests](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/1432) related to the feature. The separation of the inflight and preflight scopes is a particularly interesting aspect of this feature, and there is ongoing work to refine and optimize this separation.

If you would like to see it in action, Yoav Steinberg created a video that demonstrates how to create user resources:

### Introducing new types to the language 

We are still enriching the [Wing Language Specification](https://docs.winglang.io/contributors/rfcs/language-spec) and increasing the set of features we believe are required to build cloud applications with Wing.

We added support for `for..in` ([#1412](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/1412/)) as well as the `duration` and `datetime` types ([#1470](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/1470)). There are also duration literals minutes (e.g `5m`), seconds (e.g. `10s`), and hours (e.g. `5h`).

Let's take a look at a quick example:

```js
let timeout = 5m;
assert(timeout.seconds == 300);

let now = Datetime.utcNow();
print("It is now ${now.month}/${now.day}/${now.year} at ${now.hours}:${now.min}:${now.sec})");
assert(now.timezone == 0); // UTC

let t1 = DateTime.fromIso("2023-02-09T06:20:17.573Z");
print("Timezone is GMT${d.timezone() / 60}"); // output: Timezone is GMT-2
print("UTC: ${t1.utc.toIso())}");            // output: 2023-02-09T06:21:03.000Z
```

### JSON support

[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) is the data protocol of the cloud, and every cloud application deals a lot with it. We believe that being able to work with JSON in a native and safe way is a natural part of Wing being a "cloud-oriented language". One of the ways we're achieving this is through our concept of the [`json` type](https://docs.winglang.io/contributors/rfcs/language-spec#114-json-type).

Wing is a statically-typed language while JSON is dynamically typed. So we need a way to safely bridge between the worlds. To support this, Wing types will have a `fromJson()` static method which will allow move from the unsafe world of JSON to the safe world of static typing. 

Contrary to how JSON works in TypeScript or JavaScript, the `fromJson()` methods have built in schema validation, which means that if a call succeeded, developers can be certain that the designated type is correct.

This will also work for `struct`s (which are still not supported):

```js
struct Contact {
  first: str;
  last: str;
  phone: str?;
}

let j = Json { first: "Wing", last: "Lyly" };
let myContact = Contact.fromJson(j);
assert(myContact.first == "Wing");
```

We want to make sure that Wing is a great application and service development programming language that prioritizes safety and static typing, without sacrificing usability.

### `copy` and `copyMut`

Our built-in collections now have `copy` and `copyMut` functions üí™ ([#1427](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/1427)). These functions allow you to easily convert between the mutable and immutable collections. We had an interesting discussion around what to call these functions and decided to align them with our philosophy of *immutable by default*. This means that when you don't specify something, it's by default immutable. Even when you copy a mutable collection using the `copy` function, you will get an immutable version. We believe this is a good start for these functions and look forward to seeing how they will benefit your development projects.
