### Wing User Stories are now published to our doc site

Our user stories are ‚Äúworking backwards‚Äù documents that tell a story about someone in the future and what they can do with Wing. 
They contain detailed descriptions of where we want to be at the end of each iteration of the project. 
We believe that user stories are a crucial part of our development process as they allow us to track our progress, provide feedback, 
and ensure that we're building software that meets the needs of our users. You can see the evolution of Wing through these User Stories, 
which we think is really amazing and inspiring.

For example, [User story #15](https://github.com/winglang/wing/blob/ekeren/task-list-with-api-and-db/docs/06-contributors/999-rfcs/000-stories/story-15.md) is going contains the below content:
- [Module System - Imports (bring)](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/478): external js libs (untyped)
- [cloud.Api - Simulator implementation, cloud.Api - AWS implementation](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/623)
- [external.Redis - Simulator implementation, external.Redis - AWS implementation](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/611)
- [Interface Declaration](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/123)

### Wing Console‚Äã updates

#### Wing Console gets a new map view

[The Wing Console](https://docs.winglang.io/getting-started/console) is a graphical user interface that can be used to interact with Wing applications 
and its resources on the local machine. 
We have improved its view to a map view! The idea is to use [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) to render an interactive map of the resources generated by Wing so that we can visualize the resource hierarchy and their connections easily. The map view uses the ELK algorithm, which generates a graph of your cloud resources. [The ELK algorithm](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/documentation.html) is a layout engine that can deal with both a hierarchical structure (the resource tree) and an interaction model (the relationships between resources).

With this new map view, you can visualize both the static structure and the data flow of your cloud application at a glance. Cloud resources are connected to each other depending on usage, giving you a clear view of the dependencies and interactions between different parts of your application. You can quickly identify any bottlenecks or issues that may be affecting the performance of your application.

#### Wing Console adds support for filtering logs

We've also added a log filtering feature to help you easily filter logs by word or level! 
Check out this video for more details and usage:

#### Homage to the ‚Äúblue screen of death‚Äù

And, for your convenience, we've introduced a blue screen of death to show compiler error, making it easier to restore and navigate to the error location‚Ä¶ very nostalgic! Hopefully it doesn't trigger anyone ;) 
And a short video that shows this feature can be found here:

### User-defined resources

User-defined resources are a powerful feature in programming languages that allow developers to create reusable building blocks to organize code into logical units, which can be shared and published into libraries. In essence, they are the cloud-oriented version of a class, but with unique capabilities that allow them to represent both infrastructure and code.
([#1432](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/1432)).

One key aspect of user-defined resources is their ability to define their inflight API. This is done by adding the ‚Äúinflight‚Äù modifier to methods and fields. The inflight execution scope is essentially the runtime API of the resource, while the preflight execution scope represents the resource's configuration and initialization.

In a rudimentary example of a user-defined resource:

```js
bring cloud;
resource MyResouce {
  inner_bucket: cloud.Bucket;
  init(b: cloud.Bucket) {
    this.inner_bucket = b;
  }
  inflight my_put() {
   this.inner_bucket.put("hello", "cloud");
  }
}
Let r = new MyResource(new cloud.Bucket());
new cloud.Function(inflight (s: str): str => {
  r.my_put();
});
```

A resource called `MyResouce` is defined, containing an `inner_bucket`, which is instantiate upon initialization.  Within that resource, you can see the concept of an `inflight` modifier that can be prefixed for methods. If you need a reminder of the terms inflight and preflight, read the ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã[‚Äãspec](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#13-phase-modifiers) or the [inflight functions](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/inflights) section in the previous newsletter

Back to our example, the `init` constructor is not prefixed with `inflight`, which means that it‚Äôs a preflight execution scope. 
The `my_put` method is prefixed with `inflight`, which means that its execution scope is in a sense the runtime API of that resource.
When the `my_put` method is called on this resource, it puts the word `cloud` into an object called `hello`. 
This example demonstrates how user-defined resources can create composable units that allow for the creation of higher-level abstractions.

There are many capabilities that user-defined resources open up, and you can read more about them in the [language specification](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#33-resources), as well as in specific issues and [pull requests](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/1432) related to the feature. The separation of the inflight and preflight scopes is a particularly interesting aspect of this feature, and there is ongoing work to refine and optimize this separation. 
If you would like to see it in action, Yoav Steinberg created a video that demonstrates how to create user resources:

### Introducing new types to the language 

We are still very focused on enriching the [Wing Language Specification](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec) and increasing the set of features we believe are required to build cloud applications with Wing. 
We added the for‚Ä¶in support ([#1412](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/1412/)) as well as the duration and datetime types ([#1470](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/1470)).
We have also updated our [Wing Language Specification](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec) with json type!

The `duration` and the `datetime` type are also [built-in](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#116-datetime) types for Wing now. We have literals for minutes, seconds, and hours. We also have an initial API for datetime objects. One interesting concept that we believe is in line with the cloud orientation of the language is that there is no `Datetime.now` in Wing. When calling `now` in a cloud system, it usually refers to the system time, which is supported by `Datetime.system_now`. We decided to call it `System_now` to ensure that it is explicit to the user that they are looking at something that might not be relevant for their use case. There are some cases where you actually want UTC.now, and you want to normalize everything into something like UTC, in these cases you will use `Datetime.utc_now`. 

Few example:

```js
let now = Datetime.utc_now();
print("It is now ${now.month}/${now.day}/${now.year} at ${now.hours}:${now.min}:${now.sec})");
assert(now.timezone == 0); // UTC

let t1 = DateTime.from_iso("2023-02-09T06:20:17.573Z");
print("Timezone is GMT${d.timezone() / 60}"); // output: Timezone is GMT-2
print("UTC: ${t1.utc.to_iso())}");            // output: 2023-02-09T06:21:03.000Z
```

### Json type support

Json is the data format protocol of the cloud and every cloud application deals a lot with it, so we believe that being able to work with Json in a native and safe way is crucial. One of the ways we're achieving this is through our concept of [from_json](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#114-json-type), which allows you to move from the unsafe world of Json to the safe world of static typing. With schema validation built in, you can be sure that the runtime value is what you expect it to be, making wing a strongly typed, statically type safe programming language.
We think this is an exciting development for wing as a cloud-oriented language because it demonstrates some of its power in handling Json in a safe way. We also think it's an interesting area in terms of language design because, while languages like JavaScript and TypeScript have a strong connection to Json, it is complex and not type safe. We want to make sure that Wing is a great application and service development programming language that prioritizes safety and static typing, without sacrificing usability.

### copy & copy_mut

Our built-in collections now have copy and copy_mut functions üí™ ([#1427](https://github.com/winglang/wing/pull/1427)). These functions allow you to easily convert between mutable and immutable collections. We had an interesting discussion around what to call these functions and decided to align them with our philosophy of immutable by default. This means that when you don't specify something, it's by default immutable. Even when you copy a mutable collection using the copy function, you will get an immutable version. We believe this is a good start for these functions and look forward to seeing how they will benefit your development projects.

### The Contribution Guide‚Äã

[This](https://docs.winglang.io/contributors/) is the entry point to the winglang domain. The most crucial section for developers is the 'development' section, which contains information on setting up your development environment, prerequisites, and recommended iterations. The quickest way to get started is to clone your repository and use the 'npx nx wing' command to build and execute the Wing CLI. This command lets you quickly build and run a local copy of the Wing CLI, allowing you to experiment with the compiler domain, change the language syntax, add features to the SDK, or modify the CLI.
