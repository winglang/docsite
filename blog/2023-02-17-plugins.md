> Customizations below the abstraction line with Wing compiler plugins.

<!--truncate-->

Okay, so you have decided to write your amazing application in Wing. You have enjoyed the benefits
of Wing's cloud-oriented programming model and high level abstractions. Everything works great, the
queues are queuing, the functions are functional, and the buckets are filling. You are ready to hand
this application off to the ops team for deployment when suddenly, you are told there is a problem:
the infrastructure doesn't comply with your organizations cloud excellence requirements. 

Susan, who is an underappreciated, and sleep deprived platform engineer, tells you that your
taggable infra resources must adhere to a rigorous tagging convention. She continues to tell you
that all buckets must have versioning and replication enabled. You also gather that she was probably
going out for drinks later, since she kept going on about her security group and ciders.

Before you take to Twitter and post a long thread about how Wing is not enterprise ready, you recall
the tech lead (we will call him Greg) who gave a presentation about Wing at your organization's last
Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) meeting. Greg assured everyone that they would be able to use Wing
and only focus on the functional aspects of their cloud applications. He said this would be made
possible by leveraging the organization's custom Wing plugins. So now all that remains is, to figure
out what a Wing plugin is.

## Welcome to the Wing Plugin System

The Wing SDK is hard at work abstracting away the non-functional concerns of your cloud application.
Which is great, now you can focus on the business logic of your application and not even care about
what cloud this code will run on. However, these abstractions only solve a piece of the puzzle that
is the cloud compiler. Inevitably with any production grade deployment, we will need a way to
customize the compilation output to meet business requirements. Whether they be security,
compliance, or cost optimizations these scenarios will require drilling down bellow the
abstractions and into the compiler.

This is where the Wing plugin system comes in as the first steps to opening up hooks into the Wing
compilation process. By using these plugin hooks Wing is still able to decouple the functional and
non-functional concerns of our applications. Think of it as the SDK handles all functional concerns
such as queues, functions, and buckets, while the plugin system handles the non-functional concerns
such as encryption, versioning, and security groups. 

The plugin system is boosting the Wing toolchain into the next level of cloud development. Unlocking
the ability for teams to solve complex real world problems in Wing without compromising their
organizations cloud principles. Actually, the plugin system enables organizations to double down and
enforce their cloud principles without slowing down innovation.

### But Why?... 

I think the "why" is important to talk about for a moment. Why should developers not care about the
non-functional requirements of their application when writing code? The answer in my opinion is not
that developers should not care about it, it's that they don't want to care about it in most cases.
Developers want to focus on innovations and pushing boundaries, not be shackled by the low level
details of the cloud. This has been true through the history of software development, that we build
abstraction layers on-top of implementation details. Most developers don't want to understand the
inner workings of file systems and how they differ between operating systems. We just want to be
able to read and write files, thus we have file system abstractions. Then if we need to handle
special cases based on operating systems, or CPU architectures we expect the abstraction to give us
a way to do that, without rewriting our entire code base.

Though I think it's worth noting that the purpose of the abstraction is not to hide implementation
details and make cloud application development more vague, but rather unlock new mental models that
drive innovation.

> purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level 
in which one can be absolutely precise" - Edsger Dijkstra

This is the "why" for our plugin system in Wing, it's intended to be a mechanism that supports teams
to be more precise in their cloud applications. If the SDK unlocks this semantic level of thought,
 then the plugin system protects it. 


## The Basics of Compiler Plugins

The plugin system is a simple and powerful way to customize the compilation output of your Wing
application. It's comprised of a series of hooks that are called at various stages of the
compilation process. In our initial release of the plugin system we have made available 3 hooks:
`preSynth`, `postSynth` and `validate`. There are additional hooks that are currently in the think
tank, but we will save those for another blog post and focus on what we have available today.

To write a plugin all you need is to implement a JavaScript file, in which you can export one or all
of the compiler hooks. Once your plugin is written, you can use the `--plugin` flag in the wing cli
 to include it in the compilation process.

```sh
wing compile -t tf-aws my-app.w --plugin my-plugin.js
```

The `preSynth` hook is executed after the construct tree has been initialized but before the code
has been synthesized to produce deployment artifacts. In which our plugins have the opportunity to
add and mutate resources in the construct tree.

The `postSynth` hook's execution is right after synthesis has been completed, and provides a means
in which we can manipulate the deployment artifacts (Terraform Config, CloudFormation template,
 etc).

The `validate` hook is only executed after all compilation and synthesis has been completed. This is
important as this hook is meant to serve as a way to examine and validate deployment artifacts
without concerns that some later process will mutate them.

## Plugins In Action

No blog post on a new feature would be complete without a walk-through :) So lets walk through the
process of writing our own plugin. Not just any plugin though, but one that will help our favorite
 underappreciated platform engineer, Susan. As more teams have started adopting Wing in her
 organization she has realized that she can make use of plugins to help teams meet requirements for
 deploying applications into the cloud, without asking them to rewrite their code.

She has identified a common use case where her organization has deployed an IAM role into every AWS
Account using nested stacks. The existence of this role as a permission boundary for all IAM roles
is enforced through AWS organization SCPs (Service Control Policies). Thus, without it no IAM role can be created in the
account, this is a cause of friction for teams that want to get their Wing applications deployed
quickly. (whew thats a whole lot of things a developer should not have to care about)

She has decided to write a plugin that implements 2 hooks `preSynth` and `validate`. During the
`preSynth` hook, she wants to add the required permission boundary to all IAM roles in the construct
tree. Then she intends to validate the existence of the permission boundary on all roles during the
`validate` hook. This way teams can know their app will fail to deploy at compile time rather than
deploy, making for faster feedback loops.

Susan starts with writing the bare necessities of a plugin. She creates a file named
 `permission-boundary-compliance.js` and adds the following code:

```js
// Add permission boundary to all IAM roles
exports.preSynth = function (app) { }

// Validate that all IAM roles have a permission boundary
exports.validate = function (config) { }
```

She plans to make use of a concept from [CDKTF](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf)
known as [Aspects](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf/concepts/aspects) to traverse the
construct tree and add the permission boundary. She can safely use this since she knows her intended
target will be Terraform for AWS.

```js
const iam_role = require("@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/iam-role");
const cdktf = require("cdktf");

class PermissionBoundaryAspect {
  constructor(permissionBoundaryArn) {
    this.permissionBoundaryArn = permissionBoundaryArn;
  }

  visit(node) {
    if (node instanceof iam_role.IamRole) {
      node.permissionsBoundary = this.permissionBoundaryArn;
    }
  }
}

// Add permission boundary to all IAM roles
exports.preSynth = function (app) {
  if (!process.env.PERMISSION_BOUNDARY_ARN) {throw new Error("env var PERMISSION_BOUNDARY_ARN not set")}
  cdktf.Aspects.of(app).add(new PermissionBoundaryAspect(process.env.PERMISSION_BOUNDARY_ARN))
}
```

So above we can see she created a new Aspect class that implements the `visit` method. Each node the
aspect visits will be checked to determine if it is an IAM role and if so, set the permission
boundary which was passed into the plugin through an environment variable `PERMISSION_BOUNDARY_ARN`.

Finally for her validate step, she will simply traverse the Terraform config for all IAM roles and
check if the permission boundary is set. Even though her `preSynth` hook will have already done the
job, she knows that `preSynth` is a mutable hook and that another plugin may have altered things
after.

```js
// Validate that all IAM roles have a permission boundary
exports.validate = function (config) {
  for (const iamRole of Object.keys(config.resource.aws_iam_role)) {
    const role = config.resource.aws_iam_role[iamRole];
    if (!role.permission_boundary) {
      throw new Error(`Role ${iamRole} does not have a permission boundary`);
    }

    if (role.permission_boundary !== process.env.PERMISSION_BOUNDARY_ARN) {
      throw new Error(`Role ${iamRole} has incorrect permission boundary. Expected: ${process.env.PERMISSION_BOUNDARY_ARN} but got: ${role.permission_boundary}}`);
    }
  }
}
```

Now Susan can use the plugin in her CD pipelines to ensure that all IAM roles have the correct
permission boundary set, without imposing this non-functional requirement on the application
developers. Susan will go on to write more plugins to help her organization meet their security and
compliance requirements. She is no longer the underappreciated platform engineer we know from the
beginning of our blog post, but rather a hero with her own corner office, private parking spot, and
an on call pager that never goes off.

:::note Susan Is A Fictional Character
The outcome of her success is purely speculative. Your company may not have
corner offices so there is a chance you will have to just settle for the parking spot.
