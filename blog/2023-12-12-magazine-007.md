Hey folks!

We are back with another issue of the **Wing Inflight Magazine** and excited to share some updates about the [Winglang](https://winglang.io) project.

### An open source programming language for the cloud

Winglang is an open-source programming language for the cloud. It combines infrastructure and runtime into a single programming model, making it easy for any developer
to build serverless cloud-native applications without having to become a DevOps expert. 

Winglang code compiles to Terraform + JavaScript and can be deployed on AWS, GCP and Azure (see [support matrix](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/compatibility-matrix)).

Winglang is designed to be a familiar and friendly language to learn for developers who come from modern object-oriented background, so it will take you [5 minutes](https://github.com/winglang/workshop-react/blob/main/cheatsheet.md) to learn.

Check out our [getting started tutorial](https://www.winglang.io/docs/) or hit the [Wing Playground](https://www.winglang.io/play/) for an online experience.

### Use Typescript with Wing CLI

```js
import { main } from "ts4w";
import { cloud } from "@winglang/sdk";

main((app) => {
  new cloud.Bucket(app, "Bucket");
});
```

### Introducing .env Support

`.env` filea are now automatically loaded when compiling wing (via `wing run|test|compile`) allowing those values to be available in *preflight*.

Supports advanced usecases like interpolation.

```js
BASE_URL=https://www.winglang.io
API_BASE_URL=${BASE_URL}/api
```

And multiple file conventions based on what wing subcommand is being run

- `.env` - Always loaded
- `.env.[mode]` - Only loaded in the specified mode (eg. `run`, `compile`, `test`, etc.)

### Cloud Coverage Journey

`wing test -t tf-gcp` *now works*!

With this addition, `wing test` works for all defaule terraform-based platforms (tf-aws, tf-azure, and now tf-gcp).

### Introducing the most recent live Winglib: Websockets

Create and Interact with websocket servers.
Supported in `sim`, `tf-aws`, and `awscdk` platforms.

```js
// npm i @winglibs/websockets
bring websockets;

let ws = new websockets.WebSocket(name: "MyWebSocket");
```

Common use case is tracking and maintaining connection pool.

```js
bring ex;

let conections = new ex.DynamodbTable(
  name: "Connections",
  hashkey: "id",
  attributeDefinitions: {
    "id": "S",
  },
};
```

And here are few usages:

```js
ws.onConnect(inflight(id) => {
  connections.putItem({
    item: {"id": id }
  });
});

ws.onDisconnect(inflight(id) => {
  connections.deleteItem({
    key: {"id": id }
  });
});

ws.onMessage(inflight(id, body) => {
  for conn in tb.scan().Items {
    ws.sendMessage(str.fromJson(conn.get("id")), body);
  }
});
```

### The Wingly Update

**[The Wingly Update](https://www.twitch.tv/winglangio)** is our weird biweekly stream where we share the latest developments of the project, chat with folks from the cloud industry, geek out and celebrate the beauty of the cloud.

If you haven't been able to catch our show, you can find the complete stack of [all our episodes here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-P8v-FRassZBWsNoSafL_ReO0JO0xJVm&si=trffVrtGGMUZ-SKb).
