### Check out the latest Wingly Update episode

**The Wingly Update** is our biweekly live show where we stream to Twitch, share the latest developments of the project, and just make a bunch of fools of ourselves.

In our last show (ADD LINK), [Eyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eyal-keren-b23b7231/) hosted [Shai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shai-ber-245b1226/), [Elad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hackingonstuff/), [Mark the DJ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-mcculloh/), and a special guest, [Eric Johnson](https://twitter.com/edjgeek), who is an AWS developer advocate and Wing enthusiast.

Here are some of the topics we covered:

- Defining API endpoints in Wing
- Introducing the Redis resource
- Running tests in the cloud
- Q&A with Eric Johnson about serverless and Wing

If you didn’t get a chance to catch it live, you can tune in here (ADD LINK) and check out our next shows on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/winglangio).

### The first Wing hackathon has started

We're excited to announce that our first hackathon, known as the **wingathon**, has started!
The schedule of the hackathon is as follows:

- Thursday, April 13th - kick-off and apps presentation by the sub-teams
- Tuesday, April 18th - first check in
- Thursday, April 20th - second check in
- Thursday, April 27th - apps presentations

The goal of this hackathon is to push the boundaries of creativity and innovation by using **Wing and its existing surface area** to create a working system that is ready for actual use.
You should also be able to use any AWS resource in your Wing application through `bring "@cdktf/provider-aws"` (However, we still don’t have a great way for you to define how this behaves in the simulator). We want to challenge our team to think outside the box and come up with unique solutions to real-world problems using Wing's capabilities.

The hackathon is taking place around the world, and everyone is invited to participate at their capacity. And **don't say you didn't know** -- there will be prizes awarded for the coolest apps, so make sure you bring your A-game and show us what you got!

For more details, join us in the #wingathon-1 channel in our [Slack](https://t.winglang.io/slack). There's still time to join the fun!

### Community support for AWS CDK target introduced

Thanks to the efforts of [Marcio](link), we now have community support for the AWS CDK target in Wing! This means you run `wing compile --target=awscdk` and get a CDK application that you can deploy to AWS using CloudFormation. Here's an example of a Wing app that uses the AWS CDK target:

```js
bring cloud;
bring "aws-cdk-lib" as aws;

let queue = new cloud.Queue();
let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();

queue.add_consumer(inflight (message: str) => {
  bucket.put("latest_message.txt", message);
});

let func = new cloud.Function(inflight () => {
  queue.push("hello world!");
});

let table = new aws.aws_dynamodb.Table();
```

As you can see, several resources from our batteries-included SDK are available in the AWS CDK target. Whenever you use these resources, your app can be deployed both to AWS using CloudFormation or to the Wing simulator.

Since we are compiling to AWS CDK, we are also able to use any constructs from the AWS CDK target directly in Wing.
Since these imported resources don't know anything about Wing's "inflights", IAM permissions for these resources can't be inferred automatically by the compiler, and they won't have corresponding simulations in the Wing simulator.
But it's still possible to define permissions explicitly using AWS CDK APIs, and in the future it will be possible to specify how each foreign resource behaves in the simulator.

Try it out and let us know what you think! Huge thanks again to [Marcio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcio-almeida-25891669/) for adding support for this feature!

### New SDK resources and methods

Wing's standard library of resources is rapidly growing!
Here are the latest additions:

#### `cloud.Api`

This is your bread-and-butter API gateway resource that lets you create HTTP endpoints for your Wing app.
Endpoints are one of the easiest ways to expose your Wing app to the outside world, and they are also a great way to test your app locally using the Wing Console.
You can define routes and methods, and each route can have a handler function that will be called when a request is received. Here's an example:

```js
bring cloud;

let api = new cloud.Api();
api.get("/hello", inflight (req: cloud.ApiRequest): cloud.ApiResponse => {
  return cloud.ApiResponse {
    body: Json { message: "Hello, world!" },
    status: 200,
  };
});
```

The API resource highlights our design philosophy of making it easy to write code that works both in the cloud and in the simulator, through the use of cloud-agnostic APIs.

So far we've added support for this resource on both the `tf-aws` and `sim` targets.
When you compile to AWS, this will produce an AWS API Gateway that exposes the endpoints on the public internet -- and when you compile to the simulator, you'll get a local HTTP server that you can interact with using the Wing Console, or any other HTTP client like `curl` or Postman.

Check out our [API Reference](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/sdk#api-) for more details (docs with examples coming soon), and give us a +1 on any of these issues if you would like support for `cloud.Api` on [GCP](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/624), [Azure](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/625), or if you'd like to see a dedicated [`cloud.GraphQL` resource](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/2155)!

#### `cloud.Bucket` events

Acting on events is a great way to build reactive applications that leverage the cloud's scalability.

Wing's `cloud.Bucket` resource now supports the following events that allow you to run an inflight function when a certain event occurs:

* `on_create` - triggered when a new object is added to the bucket
* `on_delete` - triggered when an object is deleted from the bucket
* `on_update` - triggered when an object is updated in the bucket
* `on_event` - triggered when any of the above events occur

Here's an example of how you can use these events to count the number of objects added to a bucket, and expose that count through an API endpoint:

```js
bring cloud;

let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();
let counter = new cloud.Counter();

bucket.on_create(inflight (key: str) => {
  log(key);
  counter.inc();
});

let api = new cloud.Api();
api.get("/count", inflight (req: cloud.ApiRequest): cloud.ApiResponse => {
  return cloud.ApiResponse {
    body: Json { objects_added: counter.peek() },
    status: 200,
  };
});
```

#### Potpourri of new resources and methods

We've got too many new resources and additions to list them all here, but here are some of the highlights:

- `cloud.Table` - a NoSQL table that can be used to statefully manage structured information supports basic CRUD operations. Only supported on the `tf-aws` target right now. (Note: as databases are hard to abstract, this resource is highly experimental right now and is likely to change in the future.)
- `cloud.Secret` - a key-value store that can be used to store sensitive information like passwords and API keys. Currently supported on the `sim` and `tf-aws` targets.
- `redis.Redis` - a Redis instance that can be used to store unstructured data. Currently supports on the `sim` and `tf-aws` targets. When you compile to AWS, this will create a Redis instance in Elasticache hosted in its own VPC, with a security group that only allows access from the VPC that your Wing app is running in. When you compile to the simulator, this resource will use Docker to run a local Redis instance.

Lastly, we also want to bring to everyone's attention that the built-in `print()` function is now named `log()`. This is a breaking change, but we think it's a meaningful one.

`print()` is a very common function name in programming languages, and we wanted to make it clear that when you're writing an application where the cloud is your computer, `log()` has a specific intent that's distinct from emitting text to a process's standard output stream.
(For example, logs are often sent to a centralized logging service like [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) or [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/), and there isn't a distinction between printing with or without a newline in the cloud.)

But we also acknowledge that naming things is ***hard***! So if you have any thoughts on this, please let us know!
