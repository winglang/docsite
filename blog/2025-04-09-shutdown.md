> After an amazing ride, we’ve made the tough decision to shut down our company, Wing (previously Monada).

<!--truncate-->

We started this journey with a bold idea: what if building in the cloud didn’t have to be so hard? What if infrastructure and application code could live together—beautifully and seamlessly? So we created Winglang—a programming language designed to realize that vision.

We open-sourced it, and the response blew us away: over 100 contributors, lots of excitement, and an awesome community that formed around it.

But when we tried to turn that energy into a business, we hit some tough reality checks. While developer experience is something engineers care deeply about, it’s not always seen as business-critical by most companies. That made it hard to build a sustainable business around it.

Over the past year, we explored various different directions in the cloud space—looking for a problem we were both passionate about and could build a company around. In the end, we didn’t find the right fit.

So, we’re bringing this chapter to a close. It’s bittersweet, but we’re deeply proud of what we built—and even more grateful for the amazing people who joined us along the way. Winglang was a labor of love, and building it was an absolute blast.

Huge shoutout to all the incredible Wingians/Monadians who were part of this journey—and a massive thank you to our amazing investors for believing in us and backing this wild ride. Your trust and support meant the world. 🙏
