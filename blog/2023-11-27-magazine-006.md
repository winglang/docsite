Hey folks!

We are back with another issue of the **Wing Inflight Magazine** and excited to share some updates about the [Winglang](https://winglang.io) project.

### An open source programming language for the cloud

Winglang is an open-source programming language for the cloud. It combines infrastructure and runtime into a single programming model, making it easy for any developer
to build serverless cloud-native applications without having to become a DevOps expert. 

Winglang code compiles to Terraform + JavaScript and can be deployed on AWS, GCP and Azure (see [support matrix](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/compatibility-matrix)).

Winglang is designed to be a familiar and friendly language to learn for developers who come from modern object-oriented background, so it will take you [5 minutes](https://github.com/winglang/workshop-react/blob/main/cheatsheet.md) to learn.

Check out our [getting started tutorial](https://www.winglang.io/docs/) or hit the [Wing Playground](https://www.winglang.io/play/) for an online experience.

### Introducing custom platforms

An integral part of Wing's power comes from the use of [platform providers](https://www.winglang.io/docs/concepts/platforms). Platform providers are libraries which specify how and where your application is deployed. They determine both the cloud environment (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure) and the provisioning engine (e.g. Terraform, CloudFormation) that the application will be deployed with.

Today, Wing is shipped with the following built-in platforms:
 - `sim` - runs your entire app on a single machine. Used for development with the Wing Console or for unit tests with `wing test`.
 - `tf-aws`, `tf-azure`, `tf-gcp` - deployes your app to AWS, Azure or GCP using Terraform.
 - `awscdk` - deploys your app to AWS using the AWS CDK (CloudFormation).

Platform providers can also hook into the compliation process to perform any type of "bellow the abstraction" customization during preflight, either on the construct nodes or directly on the output Terraform our CloudFormation.

Built-in platforms look the same as our previously supported targets:

```js
wing compile -t tf-aws
wing compile --platform tf-aws
```

Platform providers can also be composed together:

```js
wing compile --platform tf-aws --platform tf-aws-soc2
```

Check out our documentation about [platforms](https://www.winglang.io/docs/concepts/platforms) for more details.

### Singletons, the Wing way

There are situations where it makes sense for a certain resource to have only a single
instance within a Wing application.
To facilitate that, we are now making it easy to access the root node of the app through `Node.of(this).root`. Then, with `tryFindChild()` you can get to singleton nirvana:

A common use cases for singletons in Wing is to add a [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers) only once. Other examples could be a shared resource such as a VPC that other resources across the app can use.

Check this out:

```js

class SingletonBucket {
  pub static of(scope: std.IResource): cloud.Bucket {
    let uid = "SingletonBucket";
    let root = std.Node.of(scope).root;
    let rootNode = std.Node.of(root);
    return unsafeCast(rootNode.tryFindChild(uid)) ?? new cloud.Bucket() as uid in root;
  }
}

let q1 = new cloud.Queue() as "q1";
let store1 = SingletonBucket.of(q1);

test "singleton" {
  store1.put("hello", "world");
}
```

### String interpolation syntax is getting a face lift

We decided to change the syntax of string interpolations from `${foo}` to `{foo}`. It's a stylistic choice which also offers better ergonomics in the IDE (you can just select a portion of the string and click `{` to get that portion interpolated).

Unsurprisingly, this change stirred a major emotional response in our team, and we would love to hear what people think about it.

```js
let s1 = "hello";

// Before
let s2 = "${s1}, world";

// After
let s3 = "{s1}, world";
```

❤️ [Yoav Steinberg](https://github.com/yoav-steinberg) ❤️

### Constructors are now called `new()` instead of `init()`

Another stylistic choice (this one with much less pushback) was to change the name of class constructors to `new()` instead of `init()`:

```js
class Nice {
  isNice: bool;

  new() {
    this.isNice = true;
  }
}
```

❤️ [Elad Ben-Israel](https://github.com/eladb) ❤️

### `http.fetch()` response `body` is not optional anymore

To streamline the interaction with HTTP responses, we've changed the `body` field of `HttpResponse` (returned from `http.fetch()`, `http.get()`, etc) 
to return a non-optional `str` instead of `str?`. If there is no body, the `body` will an empty string (`""`).

This means that, for example, you can simply call `Json.parse(response.body)` or `Struct.parseJson(response.body)` and move on with your life.

```js
bring http;

test "wingly" {
  let response = http.get("https://someapi.org");
  let jsonBody = Json.parse(response.body);
  // 💝
}
```

### Down-casting from `cloud.*` to `aws.*`

Winglang now supports a way to cast down an abstract `cloud.Bucket` or any Wing Cloud Library resource into its AWS counterpart. 
This makes it easy to access AWS-specific attributes (such as ARNs) given a `cloud` resoufce.

For example, let's say we want to obtain the ARN of an S3 Bucket:

```js
bring cloud;
bring aws;

let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();
if let b = aws.Bucket.from(bucket) {
  let bucketArn = b.bucketArn;
}
```

> Notice that `aws.Bucket.from()` returns an optional (`str?`), which will be `nil` in case the casting failed. This makes it easy to write
> code that's conditional on the target platform.

### Sourcemaps and Stacktraces

We've added [source maps](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/sourcemaps) to the generated JavaScript output. These are used, for example, to show `.w` files in stack traces emitted in errors.

As an example, the `except.equal()` call fails (because 5 != 8) and the stack trace ion the error only showed the compiled JavaScript code, now you'll see the `.w` files:

```js
bring expect;

let x = 2;
let y = 3;
expect.equal(x + y, 8);
```

Here's how this looks now:
