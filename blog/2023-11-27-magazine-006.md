### bring ui

Introducing the ui module to the SDK, a collection of APIs for adding visual interactions for your classes in the Wing Console. UI components aren't displayed in the Wing Console quite yet, but they can be accessed and called through the simulator API!

```js
bring cloud;
bring ui;

class WidgetService {
  data: cloud.Bucket;
  counter: cloud.Counter;
  new() {
    this.data = new cloud.Bucket();
    this.counter = new cloud.Counter();
    
    // a button lets you invoke any inflight function
    new ui.Button("Add widget", inflight () => { this.addWidget(); });
    
    // a field displays a labeled value, with optional refreshing
    new ui.Field(
      "Total widgets",
      inflight () => { return this.countWidgets(); },
      refreshRate: 5s,
    );
  }

  inflight addWidget() {
    let id = this.counter.inc();
    this.data.put("widget-${id}", "my data");
  }

  inflight countWidgets(): str {
    return "${this.data.list().length}";
  }
}

new WidgetService();
```

### Singleton

If you want to create one instance of a resource thats the way to go!
We are not making it easy to access the root app from *every* node through `Node.of(this).app` or `Node.of(this).root`. Both return the same root app, even if it's not the absolute root of the tree. `tryFindChild(id)` is also added to the app to make it easier to implement app-level singletons!

A few use cases within Wing for a singleton include: When adding a provider and ensuring the singular presence of it. Another scenario involves implementing diverse checks for storing resources in a unified global bucket, with the aim of maintaining a singular presence.

Check this out:

```js

 class SingletonBucket {
   pub static of(scope: std.IResource): cloud.Bucket {
     let uid = "SingletonBucket";
     let root = std.Node.of(scope).root;
     return unsafeCast(root.tryFindChild(uid)) ?? new cloud.Bucket() as uid in root;
   }
 }

 let q1 = new cloud.Queue() as "q1";
 let store1 = SingletonBucket.of(q1);

 test "singleton" {
   store1.put("hello", "world");
 }
```

### Remove `$` from `String` Interpolations

#### This one is a life changer :)
Before this change, we used the `$` for String interpolations, but not anymore! 
The motivation behind this one is *one less char to type*, more ergonomic and the `$` char had no practical use.  
In our context, we're using an expression inside the `string` interpolation so we need a start and end token (the curly braces) but anything else seems redundant.

This is a heck big of a deal! and it probably breaks a lot of Wing apps... but we believe its really worth it!

```js

let s1 = "hello";

// Before
let s2 = "${s1}, world";

// After
let s3 = "{s1}, world";

```

### Expose AWS Resources

Winglang now supports a way to cast a Wing `cloud.Bucket` or any Wing resource into its AWS counterpart. This means that you can actualy grant access to the main AWS resources within Wing Resources.

```js

bring cloud;
bring aws;

let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();
if let b = aws.Bucket.from(bucket) {
  let bucketArn = b.bucketArn;
}

```

### Sourcemaps and Stacktraces

This change adds sourcemap generation to the compiler. These sourcemaps are used for stacktrace rewriting in both preflight and inflight. 
Before this change, when testing code using the `expect` keyword, for instance the error message originated from JavaScript, as Wing compiles to JavaScript, and was not very clear and informative:
![sourcemaps_and_stacktraces_before](./assets/2023-11-27-magazine-006/sourcemaps_and_stacktraces_before.png)

With this change, you can now get a more informative and clear error message:
![sourcemaps_and_stacktraces_after](./assets/2023-11-27-magazine-006/sourcemaps_and_stacktraces_after.png)

### The Wingly Update

**[The Wingly Update](https://www.twitch.tv/winglangio)** is our biweekly stream where we share the latest developments of the project, chat with folks from the cloud industry, geek out and celebrate the beauty of the cloud.

If you haven't been able to catch our show, you can find the complete stack of [all our episodes here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-P8v-FRassZBWsNoSafL_ReO0JO0xJVm&si=trffVrtGGMUZ-SKb). 

Here are a few segments from the show we thought might be interesting to check out:

TBD -- Shai to cut and upload videos
