# Wing Containers Support

This library allows deploying arbitrary containers with Wing.

## Installation

Use `npm` to install this library:

```sh
npm i @winglibs/containers
```

## Bring it

The `containers.Workload` resource represents a containerized workload.

```js
bring containers;

new containers.Workload(
  name: "hello",
  image: "paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1",
  port: 8080,
  readiness: "/",
  replicas: 4,
  env: {
    "MESSAGE" => message,
  }
);
```

## Forwarding

The `workload.forward()` method returns an `IForward` object with a `fromXxx()` method for each
supported handler type.

For example, this is how you can forward `cloud.Api` requests:

```js
let work = new containers.Workload(...);
let api = new cloud.Api();
api.get("/my_request", work.forward().fromApi());
```

You can pass an optional `route` and `method` to `forward()` in order to customize the behavior:

```js
work.forward(route: "/your_request", method: cloud.HttpMethod.PUT);
```

## `sim`

When executed in the Wing Simulator, the workload is started within a local Docker container.

## `tf-aws`

To deploy containerized workloads on AWS, we will need an EKS cluster. Unless other specified, a
cluster will be automatically provisioned for each Wing application.

However, it a common practice to reuse a single EKS cluster for multiple applications. To reference
an existing cluster, you will need to specify the following platform values:

* `eks.cluster_name`: The name of the cluster
* `eks.endpoint`: The URL of the Kubernetes API endpoint of the cluster
* `eks.certificate`: The certificate authority of this cluster.

This information can be obtained from the AWS Console or through the script `eks-values.sh`:

```sh
$ ./eks-values.sh CLUSTER-NAME > values.yaml
$ wing compile -t tf-aws --values ./values.yaml main.w
```

To create a new EKS cluster, you can use the `tfaws.Cluster` resource:

`eks.main.w`:

```js
bring containers;

new containers.tfaws.Cluster() as "my-wing-cluster";
```

And provision it using Terraform:

```sh
wing compile -t tf-aws eks.main.w
cd target/eks.main.tfaws
terraform init
terraform apply
./eks-values.sh my-wing-cluster > values.yaml
```

This might take a up to 20 minutes to provision (now you see why we want to share it across apps?).
The last command will populate `values.yaml` with the the cluster information needed to deploy
workloads.

To connect to this cluster using `kubectl`, use:

```sh
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name my-wing-cluster
```

Then:

```sh
$ kubectl get all
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   172.20.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   36m
```

## Roadmap

See [Captain's Log](https://winglang.slack.com/archives/C047QFSUL5R/p1696868156845019) in the [Wing
Slack](https://t.winglang.io).

- [x] EKS as a singleton
- [ ] Container logs to Wing logs
- [x] Add support for local Dockerfiles (currently only images from Docker Hub are supported), this
      includes publishing into an ECR.
- [x] Invalidation of local docker image (both local and in registry). Check what cdk-assets is
  doing.
- [x] Reference existing EKS repository.
- [ ] Use a `cloud.Redis` database
- [ ] Implement `cloud.Service` using containers.
- [x] Reference workload from another workload (without going through the load balancer) - Microservice example.
- [x] `internalUrl()` in the simulator/aws.
- [x] `publicUrl()` in simulator/aws.
- [ ] Logging in `tf-aws` (`Disabled logging because aws-logging configmap was not found. configmap
  "aws-logging" not found`).
- [ ] Logging in `sim`.
- [ ] Publish the library
- [x] Generate helm charts under target directory
- [ ] Implement `start()` and `stop()`.
- [ ] Sidecar containers
- [ ] Domains
- [ ] How can we vend `./eks-value.sh` as part of this library?
- [ ] SSL
- [x] Nodes - what should we do there? Use Fargate profiles in EKS instead of managed node groups?
- [ ] Open bugs
- [ ] Restore microservice test (fails on GitHub).
