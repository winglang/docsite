Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing resources—like servers, storage, databases, networking, and software—over the internet ("the cloud"). Instead of maintaining physical hardware or complex infrastructure, you simply use what you need, when you need it, and pay only for what you use.

Think of it like renting instead of buying:
- You don't need to build or maintain your own power grid to enjoy electricity at home—you just plug in and pay the power company.
- Similarly, with cloud computing, you don’t need your own data center; you just connect to the cloud provider and let them handle the heavy lifting.

## Why Cloud Computing?
- **Scalability:** Start small, and grow as your needs increase—no upfront investment required.
- **Flexibility:** Access your data and applications from anywhere, anytime.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Pay only for what you use, and avoid the costs of owning and maintaining hardware.
- **Innovation at Your Fingertips:** Use cutting-edge tools, from AI to big data processing, without building them yourself.

## Examples in Everyday Life
- **Streaming Services** like Netflix and Spotify store and deliver their content using the cloud.
- **File Storage** platforms like Google Drive and Dropbox allow you to access your documents from any device.
- **Online Shopping** sites use the cloud to manage inventory, process payments, and deliver personalized recommendations.

In the next section, we’ll explore **cloud primitives**—the fundamental building blocks of cloud applications.
