In this guide, we’ll walk through the step-by-step process of creating a **file-sharing application** using **Wing** for the backend and **React** for the frontend.

This project will give you hands-on experience building and deploying a real-world cloud application, showcasing Wing’s capabilities in a practical, accessible way.

### What are we building?

The application is a **single-page application (SPA)** powered by APIs, queues, and storage. It has two core components:

1. **Backend**: Built using **Wing**, responsible for managing the core business logic and integrating with cloud services.
2. **Frontend**: A **React**-based interface for users to interact with the application.

We will develop the application locally using Wing’s built-in tools and deploy it to the cloud once it’s complete.

### Application features

The file-sharing application will include the following functionality:

- **Temporary Spaces**: Users can create temporary “Spaces” to upload and share files with friends.
- **Time-Limited Access**: Spaces are only valid for 15 minutes, ensuring files are accessible for a short duration.
- **Messaging and Attachments**: Users can send messages and attach files for their friends.
- **Email Notifications**: Friends receive email notifications when they are sent files or messages.

### What you will learn

Throughout this guide, you’ll learn how to:

1. **Build backend logic with Wing**:
   - Set up cloud infrastructure components such as APIs, queues, and storage.
   - Simulate and test the application locally with Wing’s simulation tools.

2. **Creating a React frontend**:
   - Develop an intuitive, user-friendly interface for the application.
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend APIs.
   - Connecting Wing to your frontend application

3. **Deploy to the Cloud**:
   - Use Wing’s AWS platform to seamlessly transition the application from local development to a live cloud environment.


This project is a fantastic opportunity to explore Wing’s powerful development model while building a functional, engaging application.
